# Gallery of Favorite Movies

## Description

This simple app displays a history of differant movies that have been delcared as my favorite at varying times in my life.


## Installation 

Download the files from this repo.
Once you have them in a happy folder open up your favorite code editor and navigate to this folder.
In the terminal enter "npm install" and wait a moment for the project's dependancies to download and install.
Then enter "npm run server" and "npm run client" in terminal, you are going to need two terminals for this job!
Fingers crossed!  Everything should launch and your default browser will open localhost:3000.


# Prerequisites

This is a React.js app with Node.js, Axios.  Nodemon was also useful.  Javascript, HTML and CSS are also the language framework, but that should really go without saying at this point, right?


## Usage

Click on a movie poster to get a (very) brief description of why that movie is/was a favorite of mine.
Click on that text to get the movie poster back, we'd all rather look at the picture...
Click on the "My Fav too!" button to signal that you love that movie too.


## License

I didn't make any of these movies or posters or write any of these languages this app is scripted in.  That's the power of sharing, pass it on!


## Acknowledgement

As always; shouts out to EDA for bearing with my learning process.  [Cody Njos](https://github.com/CodyNjos) was also a big help in troubleshooting.
